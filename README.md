# COS285_Lab0W

Series of methods and classes used to manipulate an object Fraction.  Fraction consists of two integer values - a numerator and a denomenator.  Using the code we have written, 
we can manipulate these fraction objects and gather data on them.  Our main method creates an array of 100 fraction objects, and our individual work can multiply, simplify, 
identifly, etc. these objects and specific characteristics of them.
